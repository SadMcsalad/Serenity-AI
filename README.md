This Mental Health AI System uses emotion detection and intelligent text analysis to help users understand and manage stress. The system uses a webcam and text input to identify emotional states, while users can log upcoming events to receive predicted stress levels based on event type. All emotional data and event logs are securely stored in a MySQL database to track trends over time. The system prioritizes privacy and security, ensuring no unnecessary data is collected and all personal information remains protected.
